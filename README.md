Computer Science IGCSE Project Grade 9

Hi, just made my first simple static website with a little bit of javascript to explain 
a concept I recently learnt in my computer science class. 
The webpage includes a beautiful gradient background and a tricolor scheme to make the page more appealing
I have also included an interactive questionnaire at the end of the page using a bit of javascript :)

I hope this site helps you learn something new and fascinating !!
